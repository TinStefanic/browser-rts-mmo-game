# browser-rts-mmo-game

Project where I attempt to build Travian-like game. Built using Visual Studio as an ASP.NET Core Razor Pages project targeting .NET 6.

To run, use command 'dotnet run' in the browser-rts-mmo-game subfolder. This will start the server and create the database (if it doesn't exist). To run app requires a mssql server '(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB' to connect with trusted connection (default used and created by visual studio).
